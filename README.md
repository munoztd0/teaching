The idea behind this page is to make available all the ressources I have gathered/created over the years make other people’s life easier.

Another purpose is to create a network of people interested in Data Science and a place for them to find information about it, so really feel free to ask for new stuff and comment on what is not working for you.

Moreover, if you are interested in the project don’t hesitate to share your stuff !

## Workshops

*Dataviz with R and ggplot2*. [Data Viz Workshop](https://we-data-ch.github.io/ggplot_basic/)

This practical will teach you the basics of ggplot2.
- Correlation: scatterplot and bubble plot
- Distribution: histogram, density and boxplot.
- Ranking: barplot, lollipop and treemap.
- Evolution: line plot and area chart

*Data wrangling with R, Python and Matlab*. [Data Wrangling Workshop](https://munoztd0.github.io/Data_Wrangling_NeuroMaster/)

The main goal of these workshop series is to create the oppurtunity for Neuroscience/Pscyhology master students to improve their skills in data wrangling through active problem solving (with hints and guidelines) that are representative of ‘real world’ problems that one will probably encounter in cogntive/affective neuroscience research.

A non exaustive list of skills/methods we are going to focus on:

- Code reproducibility (dynamic programming)
- Code understandability (comments, style, Rmarkdown, Jupyter notebook)
- Version control and code availability (github)
- Terminal familiarity
- Automatisation (creating functions)
- Data wrangling and vizualisation

*Rmarkdown Tips and Tricks*. [Rmarkdown Workshop](https://munoztd0.github.io/DAP_2021/RESOURCES/Rmardkown_tips_and_tricks.html)

<br>



*A gathering of tutorials to install and setup different tools to analyze data in psychology and neuroscience.*. [Software Workshop](https://munoztd0.github.io/Hitchhikers_guide_to_the_brain/install)

Guides for installing and setting up diverse softwares, including:
- How to install and/or setup R, Python (with Anaconda) and MATLAB/Octave
- How to install and/or setup SPM (and some toolbox), FSL and AFNI
- Basic of linux/Unix progamming, cools tips and tricks
- Git setup and tips
